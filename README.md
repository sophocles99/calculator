# Calculator

## Not another calculator?!
I initially started writing this calculator app to practise my frontend skills by recreating [a design by Fawaz Ahamed](https://dribbble.com/shots/20012393-Calculator-App-UI-Design). As the project developed I realised it was a perfect use case for the useContext and useReducer hooks, and there were some interesting challenges involved in wrapping an expanding mathematical expression upwards from the bottom right, and evaluating the expression live as the user enters it. Handling the many edge cases in the calculator logic function has been a fascinating puzzle too. So although it's unlikely to rock the mathematical world, this calculator app has provided a lot of useful practice in React hooks, TypeScript, and accessing the DOM directly.
